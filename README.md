# automated-infrastructures
This repository contains my final study assignment for the “Automated Infrastructures” case. The project involves setting up a fully automated OTAP (Dev, Test, Acceptance, Production) environment for a mid-sized web design company. We use AWS, Terraform, and Docker to deploy and manage WordPress/Joomla-based applications.
